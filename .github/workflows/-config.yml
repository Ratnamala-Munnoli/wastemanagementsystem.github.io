description: Urban waste management struggles with inefficient garbage collection and manual waste sorting. Fixed truck routes lead to missed pickups and wasted resources, while manual sorting increases errors and reduces recycling efficiency. This results in more waste in landfills, causing environmental harm and higher costs.
