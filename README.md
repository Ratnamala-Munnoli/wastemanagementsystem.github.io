### Hello, I'm Ratnamala 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

### **Waste Management System**  

**OVERVIEW:** 
1.Inefficient Garbage Collection:
* Fixed truck routes lead to missed pickups and overfilled bins.
* Increased fuel, time, and labor costs due to non-optimized routes.
2.Manual Waste Sorting:
* High error rates in sorting recyclables and non-recyclables.
* Labor-intensive and costly process with low recycling efficiency.
3.Environmental Impact:
* More waste sent to landfills, increasing pollution and landfill use.
* Higher carbon footprint from inefficient waste collection and transportation.
4.Higher Costs:
* Increased operational costs for waste collection and disposal.
* Loss of valuable recyclable resources and higher waste management expenses.
**Technical Stack:**  
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:** 
Impact of a Waste Management System (Point-wise)

1. Environmental Impact
